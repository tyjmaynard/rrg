# Field Report - Sky Bridge
## Tyler Maynard
## April 21st, 2019

I chose to analyze Sky Bridge, which lies on a roughly 0.8-mile trail at Red River Gorge. It lies less than a mile beyond the parking area past the loop. After a small trek, the adventurer is greeted with a breathtaking view of forestry and nearby cliffs and arches.

From my analytics,
it appears to be between 85ft long, a width of about 18ft, and a depth of about 50ft. From a birdseye view, this gives it and estimated area of about 1,530 square feet. I would say this is close to the actual dimensions of the landform.
