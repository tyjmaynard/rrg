## Gorge Facts

<!-- Ordered list -->
1. Red River Gorge harbors many wildlife, such as owls, woodpeckers, bears, and snakes (including the copperhead and timber rattlesnake). In addition, it houses a particular plant, namely the White-haired goldenrod, which is endemic to the sandstone outcroppings of the gorge. As you can imagine, Red River Gorge boasts a great deal of biodiversity.

2. Following a number of floods in neighboring towns and villages, the Army Corps of Engineers offered a solution: building a dam on the Red River. With the help of many protestors and Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, on December 3, 1993, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed legislation designating a portion of the river as a National Wild and Scenic River, debilitating any possibility of building a dam to preserve the biodiversity and beauty of the gorge.
